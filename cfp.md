## Field Matters! 
#### The first workshop on applying NLP to field linguistics

Field linguistics plays a crucial role in the development of linguistic theory and universal language modeling, as it provides uncontested, the only way to obtain structural data about the rapidly diminishing diversity of natural languages.

The Field matters workshop aims to bring together the urgent needs of field linguists and the vast community of NLP practitioners, developing up-to-date NLP tools for easier, faster, more reliable data collection and annotation.

**We accept three types of papers:**
+ non-archival submissions: 2-page abstracts that can present already published work or work in progress;
+ short archival submissions: 4-page abstracts that present new work;
+ long archival submissions: 8-page abstracts that present new work.

**We offer three ways of presenting the papers:**
+ the main section;
+ parallel sections;
+ the poster section plus a pre-recorded video of the presentation

The way a paper will be presented will be determined during the review process.

**All submissions should be anonymized.**

Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paperâ€™s main conference submission id. The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated. Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by TODO.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.

The workshop will run its own review process, and papers can be submitted directly to the workshop by TODO.

The workshop will take place at COLING 2022
Both papers and abstracts must follow the TODO format. Official style sheets: [Overleaf template](https://ru.overleaf.com/latex/templates/coling-2020/hfdgccxjkzqb), [Latex/Word template download](TODO).

**Please do not modify these style files.**
